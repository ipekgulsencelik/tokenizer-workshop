# Guide

This document is prepared for students who will contribute to the `tokenizer-workshop` project. The goal is to establish a common working standard for cloning the project locally, running it with `uv`, developing on a personal branch, pushing changes, and opening a Pull Request (PR).

The recommended working model for this repository is as follows:

* The main repository is the central workspace.
* The contributor **forks** the repository to their own account.
* Development is done on the contributor’s own fork, in their own **feature branch**.
* After completing the work, a **PR** is opened to the `main` branch of the main repository.

This approach both teaches a professional Git/GitHub workflow and keeps the main repository controlled.

---

## 1. Contribution approach

In this project, development is not done directly on the `main` branch.
Each student works on their own branch and opens a Pull Request to the `main` branch after completing their work.

The basic flow is:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the project
4. Define the main repository as `upstream`
5. Create your branch
6. Do the development
7. Run the tests
8. Commit your changes
9. Push to your fork
10. Open a Pull Request to the main repository

---

## 2. Requirements

The main tools used in this project are:

* Git
* Python 3.10+
* `uv`

### Checking `uv`

In PowerShell:

```powershell
uv --version
```

If it returns a version, it is ready.

---

## 3. Cloning the repository locally

### Recommended method — Working with a fork

First, **fork** the main repository to your own account via GitHub.
Then clone your fork:

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_FORK_URL>
cd tokenizer-workshop
```

Example structure:

* Main repo: `https://github.com/Burakkylmz/tokenizer-workshop.git`
* Your fork: `https://github.com/<your-username>/tokenizer-workshop.git`

### Alternative method — If you have direct access

If you have direct write access to the repository, you can theoretically clone the main repo directly:

```powershell
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd tokenizer-workshop
```

However, for training and PR discipline, the recommended approach is still **fork + branch + PR** workflow.

---

## 4. Adding the main repository as `upstream`

If you are working with a fork, after cloning, `origin` points to your fork.
In this case, you should add the main repository as `upstream`:

```powershell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Burakkylmz/tokenizer-workshop.git
```

To verify:

```powershell
git remote -v
```

Expected logic:

* `origin` -> your fork
* `upstream` -> main repository

This setup is important because it allows you to synchronize your fork as the main repository updates.

---

## 5. Setting up the project locally

After entering the repository directory, first synchronize dependencies:

```powershell
uv sync
```

This command:

* creates `.venv` (if it does not exist)
* installs dependencies according to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
* prepares the project environment

Then run the project entry point:

```powershell
uv run tokenizer-workshop
```

If this command runs successfully, the project is up and running at a basic level.

### Running tests

To run all tests:

```powershell
uv run pytest -v
```

To run a specific test file:

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/test_char_tokenizer.py -v
```

---

## 6. Pulling the latest code

Before starting work, update your local `main` branch.

### If working with a fork

First fetch the latest code from the main repository:

```powershell
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

Then optionally push it to your fork:

```powershell
git push origin main
```

### If working directly with the main repository

```powershell
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## 7. Creating your branch

Each development should be done in a separate branch.
Branch names should be clear and concise.

Example branch names:

* `feature/word-tokenizer`
* `feature/regex-tokenizer`
* `feature/regex-bpe-tokenizer`
* `feature/byte-bpe-tokenizer`
* `test/metrics-improvements`
* `docs/contribution-guide`

To create and switch to a branch:

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/<your-work-name>
```

Example:

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/word-tokenizer
```

---

## 8. Development workflow standards

When contributing, follow these principles:

* Make small and controlled changes
* Do not add unnecessary files
* Add tests along with code
* Add comments if they improve educational value
* Do not break the existing folder structure
* Do not push directly to the `main` branch

### Basic checklist

Before pushing your code, check:

1. Does the project run?
2. Do the relevant tests pass?
3. Are new files in the correct directory?
4. Is `__init__.py` updated if necessary?
5. Are changes explainable and broken into small parts?

---

## 9. Checking file changes

To see the current status:

```powershell
git status
```

To see line-level changes:

```powershell
git diff
```

---

## 10. Committing changes

First stage files:

```powershell
git add .
```

For more controlled staging:

```powershell
git add src/tokenizer_workshop/tokenizers/word_tokenizer.py
git add tests/test_word_tokenizer.py
```

Then commit:

```powershell
git commit -m "Add word tokenizer and tests"
```

### Commit message suggestions

* `Add word tokenizer and tests`
* `Add regex tokenizer implementation`
* `Add byte BPE tokenizer draft`
* `Improve tokenizer metrics tests`
* `Update contribution guide`

Commit messages should be short, clear, and start with a verb.

---

## 11. Pushing to your fork

When pushing for the first time:

```powershell
git push -u origin feature/<your-work-name>
```

Example:

```powershell
git push -u origin feature/word-tokenizer
```

For subsequent pushes:

```powershell
git push
```

Important point:

* `origin` -> your fork
* push goes to your fork first
* no direct push to the main repository

---

## 12. Opening a Pull Request

After pushing, go to GitHub and open a PR for the relevant branch in your fork.

PR direction should be:

* **base repository:** main repo (`Burakkylmz/tokenizer-workshop`)
* **base branch:** `main`
* **compare branch:** your feature branch in your fork

### What to consider when opening a PR

The PR description should answer:

1. What was added or changed?
2. Why was this change made?
3. Which files were affected?
4. Which tests were run?

### Example PR template

```md
## Summary
This PR adds the first implementation of the tokenizer.

## Changes
- Added tokenizer implementation
- Added tests
- Updated package exports if needed

## Validation
- Ran `uv run pytest -v`
- Verified local run with `uv run tokenizer-workshop`

## Notes
- This PR focuses only on the current scope
- Follow-up improvements can be added separately
```

### Example PR titles

* `Add WordTokenizer implementation`
* `Add RegexTokenizer with tests`
* `Add ByteBPETokenizer baseline`
* `Improve tokenizer evaluation metrics`

---

## 13. Post-PR revision process

After opening a PR, comments may be received. In that case:

1. Make requested changes locally
2. Run tests again
3. Commit changes
4. Push to the same branch

Example:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Address PR review comments"
git push
```

The same PR will be updated automatically.

---

## 14. Note on contributors visibility

For a contribution to appear in the main repository’s contributions:

* it must be merged into the default branch (e.g., `main`)

Just forking or committing to your fork is not enough.

Also, ensure correct Git configuration:

```powershell
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

To update:

```powershell
git config user.name "YourGitHubUsername"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

There may be a slight delay in GitHub reflecting contributions.

---

## 15. Frequently used commands

### Run the project

```powershell
uv run tokenizer-workshop
```

### Run all tests

```powershell
uv run pytest -v
```

### Run a single test file

```powershell
uv run pytest tests/test_simple_bpe_tokenizer.py -v
```

### Create a new branch

```powershell
git checkout -b feature/<your-work-name>
```

### Check status

```powershell
git status
```

### Commit

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Push

```powershell
git push -u origin feature/<your-work-name>
```

## 16. Mistakes to avoid when contributing

* Working on the `main` branch
* Pushing without running tests
* Opening very large and messy PRs
* Solving multiple unrelated topics in a single PR
* Making unnecessary refactors
* Breaking naming or folder structure
* Trying to merge non-working “draft” code into main
* Forgetting to open a PR after pushing to fork

---

## 17. Minimum expected contribution quality

For a contribution to be acceptable:

* Code must run locally
* Relevant tests must be written
* Must be compatible with the existing structure
* PR description must be clear
* Scope of change must be understandable

---

## 18. Final recommendation

The goal of this project is not only to write code, but also to explain what is written.
Therefore, when contributing, you should be able to clearly answer:

**"What did I do, why did I do it, and how did I validate it?"**

This is the most important point in PR evaluation.
